        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This sausage meat stuffing has lots of flavors and is nice and moist. You can change the ingredients to your liking. I quadruple this recipe and cook the extra in my electric roaster; that's how much everyone loves it!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>

            <li>1 pound breakfast sausage</li>

            <li>¾ cup melted butter, or as needed</li>

            <li>1 ½ cups finely diced celery</li>

            <li>¾ cup chopped onion</li>

            <li>8 cups white bread cubes</li>

            <li>3 teaspoons poultry seasoning</li>

            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>

            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>

            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer sausage to a large bowl.</li>

            <li>Pour sausage drippings into a measuring cup. Add enough melted butter to make 1 cup. Pour into the skillet over medium heat.</li>

            <li>Sauté celery and onions in butter mixture until onion is tender; do not brown.</li>

            <li>Stir in 1/3 of the bread cubes.</li>

            <li>Transfer mixture to the large bowl with sausage. Add remaining bread cubes, poultry seasoning, and pepper; mix well.</li>

            <li>Stuff bread and sausage mixture into the body and neck cavities of turkey; roast turkey as desired.</li>
